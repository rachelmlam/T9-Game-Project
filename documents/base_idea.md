# T9 Hackathon 2023 - Game Project

## Basic Idea : 
Hiding from a sudden snowstorm, you and your friends find shelter in an abandoned cabin and rest for the night. But is it abandoned? You and your friends wake to find yourselves locked in separate rooms, unable to leave your rooms, much less the cabin. You find a note, with details of how long you have until the return of the owner of the house, and he is not happy that you all are there. Did we mention he also might be a terrifying axe-carrying man? Work together with your team through trials and challenges to escape before you are confronted with the scary man.

### -starting point-
cut scene shows people going into the cabin, fade to black, and â€œwake to panicked voices and a note card with details of game, time limit (20 min?), and basic tutorial/explanation to access clues (point and click)

## __Puzzle Sequence__
### Communication Puzzles
| Room 1 | Room 2 |
|--------|--------|
| Symbols on the wall, use for decoding combo for a lock (decryption hint is in Room 2) | Ski goggles hold a paper clue (for room 1) |
| A book on a bookshelf - clue is for room 2 | Cooperation switches that need to be flipped in a certain pattern (maybe 4 switches?) - hint is in room 1 (bookshelf) |
| key is found in a locked chest that can be unlocked using a key obtained from the symbols puzzle | key is in a secret compartment that will open when the switches are in the correct position |

After both teams have unlocked their doors, they can **enter a common lobby area** as well each others' room in case some clues are yet to be found (maybe throw in some distraction/trash clues).

**Piece together papers** to get map for the treasure 
Unlock the treasure using **decoding** algorithm (Dijkstra/Shortest path graph [?])  
**Get treasure (or not lol) and key to escape the cabin!**
